In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route defined using the `Routes` component can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `useParams` hook will not work correctly, returning an empty object even if the URL parameters are present. This happens because the context provided by the router is not available to components outside the `Routes` hierarchy.
